# Dog_breed_classifier

## Image Classification for a City Dog Show
### Project Goal:

To identify dog breeds using a pre-trained image classifier.

### Problem Description:

Your city is hosting a citywide dog show and you have volunteered to help the organizing committee with contestant registration. Every participant that registers must submit an image of their dog along with biographical information about their dog. The registration system tags the images based upon the biographical information.

Some people are planning on registering pets that arenâ€™t actual dogs.

You need to use an already developed Python classifier to make sure the participants are dogs.

### Method Description:

For this image classification task I have used an image classification application using a deep learning model called as convolutional neural network. CNNs work particularly well for detecting features in images like colors, textures, and edges. These features are used to identify objects in the images. I have used a pretrained-CNN which has already learned the features from a giant dataset of 1.2 million images called ImageNet. There are different types of CNNs that have different structures (architectures) that work better or worse depending on different criteria. Here, I have explored three different architectures, namely, AlexNet, VGG, and ResNet and have determined which is best for my application.
